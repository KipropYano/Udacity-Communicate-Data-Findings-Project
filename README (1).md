# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Kiprop Yano


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

In summary;  
#### 1. Univariate exploration
From the analysis, there are 160,000 susbscribed users and 20,000 customers. This is an indication that those using Fordgo bikes have subscribed to the system, which makes sense that there are more subscribers than customers pricing. Also, most of the users are males then followed by females with most users being aged between 20 and 40 years. Other than that, most of the bike trips were between 8 and 15 minutes and not a lot of bikes lasted over 40 minutes and less than 3 minutes. Bike sharing do not occur often. 

#### 2. Bivariate exploration

From the analysis, there is a weak negative correlation between trip duration and age. The older the user, the shorter the duration of the trip. Besides, most bike sharing happens among people aged between 20 to 30 years as opposed to those aged above 40 years. Bike sharing thus increases the trip duration, which was expected. Also, Weekdays have the most trips than weekends. 

#### 3. Multivariate exploration
The correlation between gender, type of user (Customers and subscribers), bike sharing, age and trip duration is negative. This implies that the type of user, gender and bike sharing has a minimal impact on the duration of trip and age of the user. Also, in terms of gender, females have longer trip duration as opposed to males, despite being few. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

There is a strong correlation between bike sharing, trip duration age and gender. For instance, the average trip duration is higher among the customers compared to subscribers.
